# Plex Cluster in development
I didn't find anything similar - so I started this project. The idea is to use my cluster of three raspberry pi 4 for Plex Server.

# plexCluster
First try of a Plex Cluster using the following tools:

*[Unicorn Load Balancer](https://github.com/UnicornTranscoder/UnicornLoadBalancer)

*[Unicorn Transcoder](https://github.com/UnicornTranscoder/UnicornTranscoder)

*[Unicorn FFMPEG](https://github.com/UnicornTranscoder/UnicornFFMPEG)




# Plex Docker
Plex Docker used from
*[Linuxserver Plex Media Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex)

# Docker-Compose
Docker Compose for testing purposes added.
